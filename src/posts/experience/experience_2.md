Working part-time remotely at home as a mobile app developer (working on react native EXPO) while also continuing my studies in-semester. It was a tough & busy period as balance of work and study needs to be manage well and I must say that I have successfully overcome it. My responsiblities were assisting the mobile app team on debugging bugs & errors, managing android configuration, develop new features & functionality, develop front end UIs.
